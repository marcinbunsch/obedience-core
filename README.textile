h1. Welcome to Obedience!

Obedience is a workflow framework aimed at structuring the javascript code into wrappers, called Behaviors.

A single web page with javascript may have a ton of interactive features to offer to the user. 
Obedience gives the developer a solution of grouping the features and storing them in a clean and maintainable fashion.

The current version is fully functional, but is not documented properly.

h2. Testing

Tests are build in Jasmine and run on nodejs. In order to run them, install jasmine-node via npm:
  
  npm install jasmine-node

In order to run tests, you need to have "jsdom":https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom installed.
